# KINEOscraper :oncoming_automobile::bar_chart:
is a webscraping project created for the purpose of automatically downloading vehicle gauging data from the KINEO tool provided by MITMA. In this case, the extraction of the vehicle count is with an hourly breakdown and some values of 'Demarcaci√≥n' and 'Estaciones de aforamiento (ETD)' have been set for our use case. The requests for these set values and the corresponding automatic file downloads are prepared to be settled every Monday at 8am on a regular basis.
