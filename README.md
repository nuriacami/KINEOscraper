# KINEOscraper :oncoming_automobile::bar_chart:
is a webscraping project created for the purpose of automatically downloading vehicle gauging data from the KINEO tool provided by MITMA. In this case, the extraction of the vehicle count is with an hourly breakdown and some values of 'Demarcation' and 'Gauging Stations (ETD)' have been selected for our use case. The queries for these set values and the corresponding automatic file downloads are prepared to be done every Monday at 8h in the morning on a regular basis.
